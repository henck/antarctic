# TROLL BASE

You are a junior geologist (about 34 years old) assigned to the Norwegian Antarctic research station Troll. Although you love the assignment, which is the opportunity of a lifetime, it’s very, very cold. You also find that you spend most of your time cataloging ice core sample analysis results in a database, which isn’t the great adventure you were expecting. Furthermore, the confined life in the base is becoming a nuisance and you’ve been here for 4 months (the Troll station operates year-round since 2005).

The Troll station is located at Jutulsessen, a nunatak in the Gjelsvikfjellene mountain range 235 kilometers from the coast in the eastern part of Princess Martha Coast in Queen Maud Land, Antarctica, claimed by Norway as independent territory. The mountain was first photographed by the German Antarctic Expedition in 1938–39. The station has a cold and dry climate, being located in a desert. The annual mean temperature is −25 °C, with the summer temperature able to reach about 0 °C and the lowest during the winter at −50 °C. Storms, which can occur throughout the year, can occasionally make outdoor activity impossible. Being located south of the Antarctic Circle, Troll has midnight sun in the summer and polar night during the winter.

Troll station is located at the foot of the Grjotlia hill that  goes up the Jutulsessen mountain. On the other side of the mountain is the Saetet glacier. The mountain itself is horseshoe-shaped.

The story takes place during the beginning of the antarctic winter, with the sun very low and permanently on the horizon. The temperature is about -25 C (although it can vary from 0 to -50C, so it might get colder at times). There is a sharp wind that makes the temperature on the skin (face) even lower. 

The facilities consist of a module-built new section that is 300 m2 and the old section that is 100 m2. The new section consists of eight bedrooms, a gym, a sauna, a kitchen, a communications center and office space. In addition, there are several smaller buildings which are used as laboratories, provision stores, generators and garages. The old station is used partially for storage and partially as a summer station. The facility also features an emergency facility for eight people, located at a safe distance from the main base, in case of fire or other accidents. The station is dimensioned to tolerate temperatures down to −60 °C  and wind speeds of 60 meters per second.

# STORY AT TROLL BASE

A tremor goes through the base. People run around shouting things. Commander Lars Jorgensen calls you to the offices. An emergency transmission from SANAE IV (since 1997, orig. since 1962) comes in but it is garbled. You must fix the radio antenna dome, the storm or the tremors have knocked it out. An antenna piece has fallen off the top. The other scientists are off tying down equipment. The access stairs have fallen down. Driving a snowmobile there will get you to the upper stairs with access to the antenna. Storm winds will blow you off, so you must tie yourself down with a rope. The antenna can be clamped on with a C-clamp which is found in the laboratory. In the laboratory is Agnes Haugland. Report back to the commander; he will be in the communications center.

You must travel from Troll station to SANAE IV to offer help, with your Agnes, who can pilot a plane. The distance is 190 km, so it will take too long to drive the snowmobile there, plus there is a storm raging at the moment, and it could go on for some days. The only – risky – way is to go to SANAE by airplane.  Agnes will load the plane with some rescue equipment. 

The airplane needs the landing strip lights to be on, or Agnes can’t see where she’s going. You’ll have to turn on the generator for that, and for that you’ll need fuel which is the storage compartment. It’s too heavy to carry so you’ll need to transport it using the snowmobile. You’ll need a rubber hose to fill the generator, which is started by pulling a cord that’s on it. A rubber hose is obtained from the refrigerator in the kitchen. 

## Puzzles

-	Fix antenna piece to top of antenna with C-clamp, otherwise garbled message from SANAE IV cannot be understood.
-	Remove kitchen cupboard door for WHAT?
-	Storm breaks when you leave your bedroom. Stig calls you and Agnes (Agnes doesn’t come because she’s stuck in the lab) over the intercom (“Better go see Stig first”) and tells you about the lost guy. He has zero visibility and will need a beacon to get back. He called him on the radio. See if you can’t create some sort of beacon on the hilltop. 
-	Base alarm, not weather alarm. You can’t sound base alarm again after you get the letter opener.
-	Light a beacon on the hilltop for the lost guy to find his way back.
  - Find fuel
    -	You can tap some gasoline from the Cessna OR the snowmobile (truck’s not around)
    - You’ll need a jerrycan or a plastic bottle, there’s a bottle of mineral water in the fridge
    - The mineral water is frozen solid. Melt it in the sauna.
    - You’ll need a hose. Find one in the lab (may need to rescue Agnes first).
  - Find wood to burn
    - Desk parts in storage area (need key)
    - Can we have a glass cutter instead? It’s in a fire box in the hallway.
  - Find a lighter
    - It’s in the kitchen cupboard.
  - Need clamps on shoes to climb hill. 
    - The clamps are in the storage building, in a cupboard.
  - The guy arrives on foot, his truck is stuck in a hole further on. Stig accompanies the guy to a bedroom to recover, he’s half frozen to death. The rest of the guys are camped out far away from the base, waiting out the storm. Stig thanks you for your great help. Also, meet him in his office. A SANAE transmission just came in but it’s garbled. This is when a piece falls of the antenna.

- After the storm begins, the lab door slams shut and Agnes is locked in. 
  - You must break the window with the glass cutter
  - You can try with the letter opener, but you can’t manage to damage the plastic glass
  - Agnes tell you to get the key from de Frères.
  - Lab key is in des Frères’ desk. Open with letter opener.
  - Give the key to Agnes to open the door from the inside.
  - There is a key to the lab, but it won’t work – the lock is broken. 
  - Agnes suggests to tie a rope to the snowmobile and to the door handle, the pull the door out. She gives you the key to the storage building.
  - The entire door comes out (both sides) and Agnes is free.

-	A C-Clamp is in a toolbox in the vehicle garage. The toolbox itself is too heavy to carry. 
- A chain is in the storage building (for pulling vehicles). 
- Must climb radio antenna. Wind blows you off. Must tie chain around antenna and around self.
- Up on the antenna, clamp piece to antenna.
- Stig will now have received ungarbled SANAE IV SOS.

- Need Agnes to fly plane





It turns out SANAE IV has mostly fallen off its cliff, and most staff are dead. You must find the base logs to find out what happened, then radio back to Troll base. When you arrive and leave the snowmobile, a tremor goes through the cliff (nunatak), some of the rock and ice split and the snowmobile falls on its side. You will need to get down the cliff and get to the base to avoid death from exposure. 
There is a large fissure in the ice sheet and the base is threatening to tip into it. The fissure is too dark to see how deep it is. Some of the base has already fallen into it.
The base logs state that ice core drilling has caused slight, then more serious tremors. This was first attributed to shifting of the ice, although it should be rather thick here. It turns out that the drill has apparently entered a large natural cave, which was unexpected. Drilling was stopped, but the tremors have continued and actually worsened nonetheless.
There is a dead man in the radio room. Part of the roof and the window have collapsed and brained him.
When you manage to make radio contact, the conversation is short because another serious tremor goes through the base and the entire base structure starts sliding. When you leave the sliding base, you slide into the fissure with parts of the base, falling down into a U-boat dock where a single U-boat is present. 
You must quickly enter the U-boat to avoid death from exposure. Inside, you can find dry clothes. Your colleague has also fallen in, but he has fallen onto the dock. He’s miraculously alive, but both his legs are broken so he cannot move. 
You can find a German/English dictionary to help translation (or approximate a translation) for german texts founds throughout the base.
